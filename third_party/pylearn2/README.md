# Local Response Normalization

The snippet of code in this directory was taken from the Keras project; the last
visible version of it is when it was [deleted at this commit][keras-delete-lrn].

However, the code did not originate with Keras; in fact, a comment in the code
states:

> ```
> This code is adapted from pylearn2.
> License at: https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
> ```

Hence, this code is under the BSD-3-Clause license of the pylearn2 project
(included in this directory as [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt)), rather than the
Apache 2.0 license of the Keras project.
