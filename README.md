# Reimplementing ML papers

The goal of this project is to reimplement various ML papers, learn about ML
model architectures and libraries, and see how close we can get to published
results.

Current implementations:

* [LeNet](lenet) (1998)
* [AlexNet](alexnet) (2012)
* [VGG](vgg) (2015)
* [GoogLeNet](googlenet) aka _Inception v1_ (2015)
