# AlexNet

In this directory, we aim to implement the AlexNet architecture for a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for image classification, to be tested
with the ImageNet dataset.

Available implementations:

|      | Description    | Library | Notebook |
|:----:| -------------- |:-------:|:--------:|
|  v1  | Basic impl     |  Keras  | [![View on GitHub][github-badge]][github-basic] [![Open In Colab][colab-badge]][colab-basic] [![Open in Binder][binder-badge]][binder-basic] |

Implementation notes for v1:

1. We haven't yet trained or tested this network, as we don't yet have access to
   the ImageNet dataset which requires registration & approval to be able to
   download it.
2. We haven't yet implemented the Local Response Normalization layer after the
   first two convolutional passes; the points where they should be added are
   marked with `TODO`s in the notebook.
3. This simple implementation does not split the data across 2 GPUs as described
   in the paper for simplicity, and because we no longer have such resource
   constraints in today's GPUs.

Our implementation is based on the following paper:

* Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. 2012. ImageNet
  Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. In Proceedings of the
  25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems -

# Input size discrepancy

Note that the original AlexNet paper refers to inputs as $224 \times 224$
images; however, that does not work out to have $55 \times 55$ images as the
output from the first convolutional layer. There's consensus that the only way
to achieve that is to use input images of size $227 \times 227$, or images of
size $224 \times 224$ with a 3-pixel zero-padding, which makes it work.

Here are several references which agree on this analysis of input shape:

1. [Classic Networks][classic-networks] lecture by Andrew Ng as part of the Deep
   Learning specialization

   > If you read the paper, the paper refers to $224 \times 224 \times 3$
   > images, but if you look at the numbers, the numbers only make sense if they
   > are $227 \times 227 \times 3$.

2. [Stanford CS231n][stanford-cs231n]

   > As a fun aside, if you read the actual paper it claims that the input
   > images were 224x224, which is surely incorrect because (224 - 11)/4 + 1 is
   > quite clearly not an integer. This has confused many people in the history
   > of ConvNets and little is known about what happened. My own best guess is
   > that Alex used zero-padding of 3 extra pixels that he does not mention in
   > the paper.

3. [Data Science SE][datascience-se]

   One answer also quotes Andrew Ng's lecture in (1) above. Another answer
   demonstrates via calculation that the $224 \times 224$ input shape would
   result in a non-integral output shape, and hence, must be an error, similarly
   to the Stanford CS231n class notes in (2) above.
