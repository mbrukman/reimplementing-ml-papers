# AlexNet

In this directory, we aim to implement the AlexNet architecture for a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for image classification, to be tested
with the ImageNet dataset.

Implementation notes for ImageNet v1:

1. We haven't yet trained or tested this network (work in progress).

## References

Our implementation is based on the following paper:

  25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems -

## Local Response Normalization

Per the AlexNet paper, the _Local Response Normalization_ layer computes the
following function:

$$
b_{x,y}^i = a_{x,y}^i /
    \left(
        k + \alpha \sum_{j = \max(0, i-n/2)}^{\min(N-1, i+n/2)}
        \left(a_{x,y}^j \right)^2
    \right) ^ \beta
$$

The paper authors chose $k = 2, n = 5, \alpha = 10^{-4}, \beta = 0.75$.

We provide 2 implementations of the Local Response Normalization layer:

* one in this directory,
  [`local_response_normalization.py`](local_response_normaliation.py) as a very
  light wrapper around [`tensorflow.nn.local_response_normalization`][tf-nn-lrn]
  layer which was written as a result of this paper
* another one in
  [`third_party/pylearn2/local_response_normalization.py`](../third_party/pylearn2/local_response_normalization.py)
  which is based on the Pylearn2 implementation and adapted in the Keras project

## Input size discrepancy

Note that the original AlexNet paper refers to inputs as $224 \times 224$
images; however, that does not work out to have $55 \times 55$ images as the
output from the first convolutional layer. There's consensus that the only way
to achieve that is to use input images of size $227 \times 227$, or images of
size $224 \times 224$ with a 3-pixel zero-padding, which makes it work.

Here are several references which agree on this analysis of input shape:

1. [Classic Networks][classic-networks] lecture by Andrew Ng as part of the Deep
   Learning specialization

   > If you read the paper, the paper refers to $224 \times 224 \times 3$
   > images, but if you look at the numbers, the numbers only make sense if they
   > are $227 \times 227 \times 3$.

2. [Stanford CS231n][stanford-cs231n]

   > As a fun aside, if you read the actual paper it claims that the input
   > images were 224x224, which is surely incorrect because (224 - 11)/4 + 1 is
   > quite clearly not an integer. This has confused many people in the history
   > of ConvNets and little is known about what happened. My own best guess is
   > that Alex used zero-padding of 3 extra pixels that he does not mention in
   > the paper.

3. [Data Science SE][ds-se-q]

   [One answer][ds-se-a1] also quotes Andrew Ng's lecture in (1) above. [Another
   answer][ds-se-a2] demonstrates via calculation that the $224 \times 224$
   input shape would result in a non-integral output shape, and hence, must be
   an error, similarly to the Stanford CS231n class notes in (2) above.
